      p
        | While SmartUnderline works great on blogs and in other controlled-text enironments,
        | there are a few things you should be aware of when considering using SmartUnderline
        | on your website.

      ul
        li
          | It requires that the text be on top of a solid background color.
        li
          | It makes an assumption about selection color, which is OS- and browser-dependent.
        li
          | Each smart-underlined link has 12 text-shadows drawn underneath it, which could potentially have performance penalties on mobile or older devices.
