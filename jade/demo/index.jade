    section.limitations
      h3 Known limitations

      p
        | While SmartUnderline works great on blogs and in other controlled-text enironments,
        | it has performance considerations and limitations which prevent it from being
        | an all-purpose link styling option.

      ul
        li
          | It requires that the text be on top of a solid background color.
        li
          | It has performance considerations due to its heavy use of text-shadow.
        li
          | It makes an assumption about selection color, which is OS- and browser-dependent.
